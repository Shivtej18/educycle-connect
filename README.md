# EduCycle Connect 📚♻️

**Sustainable Education Initiative**

EduCycle Connect bridges the gap between students who have extra resources and those who need them, while ensuring responsible recycling of materials that can't be reused. It connects donors, students, and NGOs to create a circular economy for educational resources.

## 🌟 Features

- **Resource Donation**: easily donate textbooks and notebooks.
- **Smart Classification**: Resources are classified as reusable (for distribution) or for recycling.
- **NGO Dashboard**: empowered tools for NGOs to manage collection points and distributions.
- **Collection Points**: Locate nearby drop-off centers for donations.
- **Impact Tracking**: Monitor the "Students Helped" and "Environmental Impact".
- **Role-Based Access**: Dedicated portals for Students and NGOs.
